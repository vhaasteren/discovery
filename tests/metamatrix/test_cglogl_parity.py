"""matrix-vs-metamath parity for `ArrayLikelihood.cglogL` (D20).

`cglogL` -- the conjugate-gradient log-likelihood for very large arrays (CG
solve + stochastic-Lanczos log-det estimator) -- was the one likelihood frontend
with no parity coverage. It is iterative and its log-det is a stochastic
estimate, so machine precision is not expected: `rtol=1e-6` is the honest gate.

WHY THIS SKIPS TODAY. `cglogL` is currently broken on BOTH routes, and the
breakage predates this cleanup (verified against the pre-cleanup commit):

  * its CG/log-det helpers are optional extras (`jaxopt` + `matfree`), undeclared
    in pyproject and absent from the devcontainer -- so `utils` defines neither,
    and `cglogL` raises AttributeError before any math runs;
  * with `matfree` present, the metamath route has no
    `VectorWoodburyKernel.make_kernelterms` (globalgp branch) and returns an
    unwrapped graph (commongp-only branch);
  * the matrix route's globalgp branch dies inside the CG stack on a JAX API
    change (`matrix_transpose` rejects 1-D input).

Repairing that is out of scope for the graph-consistency cleanup (see
docs/metamatrix.md, "cglogL is not currently runnable"). This test is committed
so it starts enforcing parity the moment the path is repaired, rather than
being written from scratch then.
