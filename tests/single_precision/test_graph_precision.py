"""Graph-precision pass, stage 1 -- blanket working dtype at materialization.

The metamath materialization boundary (metamatrix.build_callable_from_graph,
reached via func()) casts every floating leaf -- args, constants, PSD/func-leaf
outputs -- to utils.working_dtype() when single precision is active. Stage 1 is
the *blanket, no-pins* baseline: the ENTIRE Woodbury (including the would-be f64
pins ytNmy / logdets) runs in the working dtype. These tests lock that path:

  * float64 default is untouched (the cast is the identity unless working=f32);
    covered structurally by the metamatrix parity suite, asserted here too.
  * under working=float32 the single-pulsar logL is finite and close to f64
    (no pins are needed at single-pulsar scale -- the ytNmy cancellation only
    bites across the full array; that motivates the pins, added next).

Requires the metamath backend (ds.config(kernels='metamath')) -- the cast lives
in the metamath graph; the legacy matrix.py path is unaffected.

#
# Two things are checked: (1) the f32 logL is finite, close to f64, and has finite
# gradients (sampler safety -- the real array data point); (2) the dtype-map
# structure on the fused graph is correct: every pinned node (raw per-pulsar
# y^T N^-1 y, lN, lP) is float64, and every cho_factor (inner per-pulsar + outer
# global Cholesky, the lS terms) stays the working float32. The white-box check is
# the real payoff: it locks the "pin the raw y^T N^-1 y at source, NOT the
# projected ytNmy_proj" decision -- pinning the projected term would silently drag
# the inner Cholesky to f64 and kill the f32 speed win.
