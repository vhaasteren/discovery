# Metamatrix: graph-based kernels

*Status of the `metamatrix-meyers` branch. Audience: Discovery developers.*

Source links below point at the `metamatrix-meyers` branch on GitHub.

## TL;DR

`matrix.py` enumerated the Woodbury kernel `Σ = N + FPFᵀ` as a combinatorial
family of hand-written const/var classes. **Metamatrix** replaces that with a
small graph DSL: kernels are expressed once, symbolically, and graph *folding*
specialises constant vs variable inputs at trace time — so the variant explosion
collapses to one class per concept. Both paths are live behind
`ds.config(kernels=…)`, and a suite of tests that build each model both ways and
compare the results certifies the graph path reproduces `matrix.py` to machine
precision — the prerequisite for eventually deprecating `matrix.py`.

This builds directly on Michele's original metamatrix design; the work here
carried it to feature-completeness (Phases 0–4) and added the test scaffolding,
the runtime switch, and the example/cookbook surface.

## Motivation

For `Σ = N + FPFᵀ`, each of `N`, `F`, `P` is independently fixed-at-trace-time
("constant") or parameter-dependent ("variable"). `matrix.py` enumerates the
combinations by hand:

- **Woodbury:** [`WoodburyKernel_novar`, `_varP`, `_varN`, `_varNP`, `_varFP`,
  `VectorWoodburyKernel_varP`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/matrix.py)
  — six classes.
- **NoiseMatrix:** `NoiseMatrix1D_{novar,var}`, `NoiseMatrix2D_{novar,var}`,
  `NoiseMatrixSM_{novar,var}`, `VectorNoiseMatrix{1D,2D}_var` plus the
  `…12D_var` ndim-dispatchers.

Adding a feature meant touching 4–6 sibling classes. The graph rewrite expresses
the math symbolically and lets folding handle const-vs-var, eliminating the
combinatorial surface. See
[`dev_architecture/metamatrix/metamatrix_architecture.md`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/dev_architecture/metamatrix/metamatrix_architecture.md)
for the design rationale and the house rules for writing graph code.

## Architecture / module map

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| [`metamatrix.py`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/metamatrix.py) | The graph DSL: leaves, nodes, `@graph`, folding/pruning, and `func()` which materialises a graph into a callable. `func()` is called **once**, at the likelihood boundary. |
| [`metamath.py`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/metamath.py) | The kernel/GP layer built on the DSL: `NoiseMatrix{,1D,2D,SM}`, `WoodburyKernel`, `GlobalWoodburyKernel`, `VectorWoodburyKernel`, `CompoundGP`, `CompoundDelay`. Methods return graphs; they never call `func()` or materialise internally. |
| [`utils.py`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/utils.py) | Path-neutral substrate: numerical backend config (`config(backend=…)`, the `jnp`/`jsp`/precision/factorisation globals, `cgsolve`, `make_logdet_estimator`) **and** the GP/Kernel marker types (`Kernel`, `GP`, `ConstantGP`, `VariableGP`, `GlobalVariableGP`, `ExtSignal`) + the indexed Sherman–Morrison helpers. Imported by both paths. |
| [`_kernels.py`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/_kernels.py) | The kernel-constructor **factory**. `signals.py` builds kernels by name through it; `set_mode()` (driven by `ds.config`) selects matrix vs metamath classes. |
| [`_kernel_switch.py`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/_kernel_switch.py) | Used only by the tests: temporarily replaces the `matrix.*` kernel names with their metamath equivalents, so the *legacy* likelihood code can be run on the *new* kernels without editing it. It reads its name→class map from `_kernels`, so the two can never disagree. |
| [`signals.py`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/signals.py) / [`measurement_noise.py`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/measurement_noise.py) | Model builders (`makegp_*`, `makecommongp_*`, `makeglobalgp_*`, `makedelay`, …). Build kernels through the factory + markers, so they are backend-agnostic. |
| [`likelihood.py`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/likelihood.py) | The original closure-based likelihoods built on `matrix.py`. Kept as the reference implementation we compare the new path against; removed once `matrix.py` is deprecated. |
| [`likelihood_metamath.py`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/likelihood_metamath.py) | Metamath-native likelihoods (`PulsarLikelihood`, `GlobalLikelihood`, `ArrayLikelihood`), composing metamath kernels directly. Replaces `likelihood.py` once `matrix.py` is deprecated. |
| [`recipes/`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/recipes/__init__.py) | Importable "model zoo" — the exact models the comparison tests exercise and the [cookbook](tutorials/cookbook_models) renders. |

## Kernel routes and the `config` switch

`ds.config(kernels='matrix'|'metamath')` selects the kernel subsystem (distinct
from `utils.config(backend='numpy'|'jax')`, which selects the numerical backend).
It does two things: sets the `_kernels` factory mode, and rebinds the top-level
`PulsarLikelihood`/`GlobalLikelihood`/`ArrayLikelihood` to the matrix or metamath
implementation. Call it **before** building a model.

`signals.py` never names a kernel implementation — it calls
`kernels.NoiseMatrix1D_var(…)` etc., and the factory resolves the name per mode
(metamath classes from a canonical map, else fall through to `matrix.*`). This
replaced the persistent `matrix.*` monkeypatch that the production metamath path
formerly relied on.

The comparison tests build **every model three ways** and check the results
match:

| How the model is built | What it isolates |
|---|---|
| original likelihood + `matrix.py` kernels | the reference result |
| original likelihood + metamath kernels (swapped in via the test-only monkeypatch) | that the new *kernels* alone reproduce the reference, independent of the likelihood rewrite |
| new metamath likelihood + metamath kernels | that the end-state path reproduces the reference |

The monkeypatch is now used only by these tests; the production metamath path
uses the explicit factory instead.

## Old → new mapping

Graph folding dissolves the const/var (and the 1D/2D/vector) distinctions, so the
matrix variant families collapse to one class each.

| `matrix.py` (old) | metamath (new) | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `WoodburyKernel_{novar,varP,varN,varNP,varFP}` | [`WoodburyKernel`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/metamath.py) | const/var by folding |
| `VectorWoodburyKernel_varP` | `VectorWoodburyKernel` | + `make_conditional` (new; matrix had none) |
| — (assembled ad hoc) | `GlobalWoodburyKernel` | first-class global (HD) kernel |
| `NoiseMatrix1D_{novar,var}` | `NoiseMatrix1D` | array *or* callable |
| `NoiseMatrix2D_{novar,var}` | `NoiseMatrix2D` | array *or* callable |
| `NoiseMatrix12D_var` (dispatch) | `NoiseMatrix12D` | ndim dispatch retained |
| `NoiseMatrixSM_{novar,var}` | `NoiseMatrixSM` | indexed Sherman–Morrison |
| `VectorNoiseMatrix{1D,2D,12D}_var` | `NoiseMatrix1D/2D/12D` | "vector" distinction dissolved |
| `CompoundGP`, `VectorCompoundGP` | `CompoundGP` | + mixed-Φ marginalised path (new) |
| `CompoundGlobalGP` (in `matrix.py`) | `signals.CompoundGlobalGP` | relocated, backend-agnostic |
| `CompoundDelay` | `CompoundDelay` | unchanged contract |

The factory's name→class map is the canonical encoding of this table:
[`_kernels._METAMATH`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/_kernels.py).

## Functionality: changed and added

- **Measurement-noise collapse.** `makenoise_measurement{,_simple}` moved to
  [`measurement_noise.py`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/measurement_noise.py)
  in collapsed form: the four `_novar`/`_var` terminal returns became two
  variant-agnostic factory calls (`NoiseMatrix1D` / `NoiseMatrixSM`), the variant
  chosen from whether the argument is an array or a callable. `signals.py`
  re-exports them.
- **Mixed-Φ `CompoundGP`.** A compound of a per-pulsar-diagonal (1D) GP and a
  dense (2D, e.g. HD) GP. The coefficient-log-prior / `Phi=None` branch is now
  gated to the vector/decentered path; a mixed but *marginalised* compound builds
  a real combined dense Φ (block-diagonal, 1D blocks promoted to dense).
- **`CompoundGlobalGP` relocated** out of `matrix.py` to a backend-agnostic
  `signals.CompoundGlobalGP` (factory + markers), so a list of global GPs
  (e.g. HD + monopole) works under both paths.
- **ExtSignal / continuous wave.** `ExtSignal` (in `utils.py`) carries a
  deterministic signal on its own higher-frequency Fourier basis;
  [`makecw_extsignal`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/deterministic.py)
  + `make_extsignal_fourier` fold it into `ArrayLikelihood` via GP cross-terms,
  with the CW parameters never entering the GP prior.
- **Decentering, means, conditional.** `ArrayLikelihood` supports decentered
  (whitened-coefficient) sampling, per-GP prior `means`, and `conditional` /
  `clogL` on the vector Woodbury path (the latter has no `matrix.py` analogue).
- **2-D covariance bases.** `makegp_fftcov`/`avgcov`/`intcov` and
  `makegp_fourier_variance` (dense `NoiseMatrix2D`) run through the graph path.
- **Backend substrate.** Numerical config and the GP/Kernel markers were pulled
  out of `matrix.py` into `utils.py`, so neither path reaches into the other.

## What has been checked

The comparison tests (`tests/metamatrix/`) check that `logL`, `conditional`,
`clogL`, `sample`, and `sample_conditional` agree — between the original
`matrix.py` path and the new metamath path (both run through the original
likelihood and through the new metamath likelihood) — to machine precision, on
real NANOGrav pulsars. Coverage spans, at minimum:

- **Single pulsar:** white noise (simple + per-backend), ECORR as a GP and folded
  via Sherman–Morrison, marginalised + variable timing models, power-law red
  noise (incl. `concat=False` chained Woodburys), multiple variable GPs (RN + DM),
  2-D `fftcov` and fixed-variance Fourier GPs, deterministic delays.
- **Global:** independent pulsars, HD- and monopole-correlated global GPs, and a
  compound (HD + monopole) global GP.
- **Array:** intrinsic (vectorised) red noise, intrinsic + common-spectrum via
  `make_combined_crn`, intrinsic + HD global, decentered variants, per-GP means,
  and a CW ExtSignal.

Every kernel constructor that production code or the example notebooks emit is
exercised by at least one of these models; the audit and disposition of each is in
[`dev_architecture/metamatrix/phase3_coverage.md`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/dev_architecture/metamatrix/phase3_coverage.md).
These same models are the importable [`discovery.recipes`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/src/discovery/recipes/__init__.py)
rendered in the [cookbook](tutorials/cookbook_models) — so the documented models
and the checked models are the same objects.

A real-scale check (5 pulsars, CW + HD global + decentered common RN) agrees
between the two kernel paths to ~1e-9 relative.

A parity test for `cglogL` exists (`tests/metamatrix/test_cglogl_parity.py`,
3-pulsar fixture, `intrinsic_rn_plus_global_hd`, 3 draws, `rtol=1e-6` — loose on
purpose, since the solve is iterative and the log-det is a stochastic estimate).
It **skips by default**: see "cglogL is not currently runnable" below.

### Not yet cross-checked

- **`cglogL` is not currently runnable — on either route.** It was never
  cross-checked, and investigating that (D20) turned up why: it is broken
  independently on both paths, and the breakage predates the graph-consistency
  cleanup.
  - Its CG solve and Lanczos-Hutchinson log-det estimator need the *optional*
    `jaxopt` + `matfree` extras, which are undeclared in `pyproject.toml` and
    absent from the devcontainer. Without them `utils` defines neither helper,
    `matrix.py` re-exports neither, and `cglogL` raises `AttributeError`
    immediately.
  - With `matfree` installed, the metamath route raises
    `AttributeError: 'VectorWoodburyKernel' object has no attribute
    'make_kernelterms'` for the globalgp branch, and returns a raw graph (never
    `ffunc`-wrapped) for the commongp-only branch — so metamath `cglogL` has
    never worked.
  - The matrix route's commongp-only branch does work; its globalgp branch dies
    inside the CG stack on a JAX API change (`matrix_transpose` now rejects 1-D
    input). `matfree`'s own API has also drifted (`funm.integrand_funm_sym` is
    gone at 0.6.x; `utils` targets ~0.5.x).

  Making `cglogL` work again is real repair work — a `make_kernelterms` on
  `VectorWoodburyKernel`, an `ffunc` wrap, a JAX-compat fix, and a pinned
  `matfree` extra — and is deliberately out of scope for the cleanup. The parity
  test is committed and skips on the missing extras, so it starts enforcing
  parity the moment the path is repaired.
- **Performance.** The comparison-test suite checks correctness, not speed — there
  is no general `matrix.py`-vs-metamath timing comparison. (The single-precision
  work *does* have an HD-model benchmark: matrix vs metamath, `float64` vs `float32`;
  see the section below.)
- **GPU.** The comparison tests run on CPU in `float64`. The graph path is
  JAX-native; it has now been exercised on GPU (GH200) for the single-precision HD
  benchmark below, but broader GPU coverage of the comparison suite is still pending.
- **Samplers.** The numpyro samplers ride on `logL`/`clogL` (which are checked),
  but no end-to-end sampling comparison has been run.

## Single precision (float32) on GPU

GPUs are far faster in `float32`, but a PTA marginal `logL` subtracts large numbers
(a quadratic form $\sim 10^6$, log-determinants $\sim 10^4$) to land on an $O(1)$
result. At the `float32` ulp of a $10^6$-scale number ($\approx 0.06$) that result is
swamped, so a blanket-`float32` likelihood is too imprecise to sample with. Three
complementary pieces address this. All are **opt-in** and byte-identical to the
`float64` path when off; the user-facing comparison is in the
[single-precision tutorial](advanced/single_precision).

- **Half A — `float64` final combine.** The expensive factorisations stay in the
  working (`float32`) dtype, but the final scalar assembly (the big `ytNmy − quad`
  subtraction and the log-determinant sum) is done in `float64` (`combine_f64` /
  `pin_f64`), with the per-pulsar raw quadratics and white-noise log-dets pinned to
  `float64` at source. This protects the *combination*, not the building of `mu`
  (which is still born from the `float32` Cholesky).
- **Half B — reference + delta.** Freeze each GP level's prior covariance once at a
  reference point $\theta_{\rm ref}$ (in `float64`), and evaluate
  $\ln L(\theta) = \ln L_{\rm ref} + \Delta\!\ln L$: $\ln L_{\rm ref}$ carries the large
  pieces (`float64`, computed once) and `float32` only ever holds the $O(1)$
  increment, built directly via a resolvent identity (never a current−reference
  subtraction of two large log-likelihoods). Opt in with
  `ArrayLikelihood(..., reference=θ_ref)`. The fused two-level HD path has
  reference+delta twins (`vectorwoodburyjointsolve_refdelta` →
  `globalwoodbury_fused_refdelta`).
- **Timing-model projection.** Handle the timing model $M$ by projection (the exact
  flat-prior limit) instead of a huge-variance prior — `float32`-safe, and it keeps
  the corrections. Opt in with `makegp_timing(..., project=True)`.

Status (12 pulsars, NG15 HD model; precision vs the `float64` truth):

| flavor | max \|ΔlogL\| vs truth | note |
|---|---|---|
| `float64` | $\sim 10^{-8}$ | machine precision |
| blanket `float32` | $\sim 7\times 10^{-2}$ | sampling-fatal; worsens with array size |
| reference+delta `float32` | $\sim 10^{-3}$ (CPU) | on GPU the floor is TF32 ($\sim 10^{-2}$) |

On speed, the reference+delta fused HD kernel now costs **~1.5× the `float64` path's
FLOPs** (and ~1.5× its wall-clock on a GH200), down from ~74× before the outer
log-determinant increment was rewritten to reuse the Cholesky log-dets it already
computes. So the accurate `float32` path is roughly as fast as the normal path while
recovering most of the precision.

**Done:** Half A, Half B (incl. the fused HD reference+delta twins and the
outer-increment speedup), and projection are implemented and have a precision/speed
harness + unit tests. **Remaining:** scaling re-measurement at 45/67 pulsars on GPU;
optionally recovering the GPU TF32 floor with `jax_default_matmul_precision='highest'`;
and routing reference+delta for the single-level (CURN/IRN) `vectorwoodbury` path
(currently HD-only). Design decisions and notes live in
[`dev_architecture/single_precision/`](https://github.com/meyers-academic/discovery/blob/metamatrix-meyers/dev_architecture/single_precision/)
(README, research notes, and ADRs 0001–0004).

## Status and remaining work

- **The metamath path is feature-complete.** Shared substrate extracted,
  `signals.py` building through the factory, `likelihood_metamath` free of
  `matrix.py`, every used constructor checked, and the last two hard cases closed
  (the all-constant 2-D GP prior, and combining a list of global GPs). Nothing in
  the comparison tests is left failing or skipped.
- **What remains is the deprecation itself:** once we're confident enough to drop
  `matrix.py`, we delete it and the original `likelihood.py`, collapse the factory
  to metamath-only, drop the test monkeypatch, and rename `likelihood_metamath.py`
  → `likelihood.py`. That's deliberately held until the metamath path has been
  exercised on real analyses (this review is part of that).
- **Known limitation — single-level refdelta routing is HD-only.** The
  reference+delta opt-in (`ArrayLikelihood(reference=...)`) reaches the
  single-level (CURN/IRN) case only through the current
  `vectorwoodbury_refdelta` twin; carrying it to `vectorwoodbury` proper is
  future work, tracked as an issue. This is by design of the existing twins and
  is deliberately **not** addressed by the graph-consistency cleanup.
- **Known limitation — chained variable GPs on the legacy route.**
  `PulsarLikelihood(concat=False, marginalize_all_but_last=True)` builds on both
  routes, but its `clogL` evaluates only under `kernels='metamath'`:
  `matrix.WoodburyKernel_varNP` reaches for `make_solve_1d` on its inner
  `WoodburyKernel_varP`, which does not define it. The matrix path is frozen for
  Phase 5 deletion, so this is recorded rather than fixed.
